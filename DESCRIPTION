Title: MethylMix: Identifying methylation driven cancer genes
Version: 2.3.1
Description: MethylMix is an algorithm implemented to identify hyper and
    hypomethylated genes for a disease. MethylMix is based on a beta mixture model
    to identify methylation states and compares them with the normal DNA methylation
    state. MethylMix uses a novel statistic, the Differential Methylation value
    or DM-value defined as the difference of a methylation state with the normal
    methylation state. Finally, matched gene expression data is used to identify,
    besides differential, functional methylation states by focusing on methylation
    changes that effect gene expression. References: Gevaert 0. MethylMix: an R
